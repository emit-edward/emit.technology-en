<h1 id="pins-privacy-policy">PINs Privacy Policy</h1>
<h3 id="last-updated-january-20-2023">Last Updated:  January 20, 2023</h3>
<p>PINs is an ecological application based on the EMIT decentralized protocol, which is built on top of the EMIT protocol and the Web3 framework. PINs allow people to build their own VERSE and create content in the form of multiplayer role-playing games. This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) helps explain how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use the App, our developer software, or our website at <a href="https://pins.emit.technology">https://pins.emit.technology</a> (collectively the “Services”). Please also read PINs Terms of Service (the “Terms”), which describe the terms under which you use the Services.</p>
<p><em>Please note that all client software for PINs has been developed and maintained by <strong>Engine Link Future Technology PTE LTD</strong> to date.</em></p>
<h2 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We receive or collect information when we operate and provide our Services, including when you install, access, or use our Services.</p>
<h3 id="information-you-provide">Information you provide</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Your Identity Information </strong>- As PINs is built on the Web3 framework, the private key or mnemonic phrase you use for authorization is only stored on your own device and will never be uploaded or collected in any way by PINs. However, your public key address will be uploaded to our decentralized and centralized nodes along with the signature data.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Your Created Content </strong>- Since PINs is a decentralized platform designed for creating and sharing content, we will retain the content you create on our decentralized or centralized nodes as part of our normal process of providing services to you.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Your External Community Declarations </strong>- In certain special circumstances, we may require you to make a specific declaration on other platforms to link your public key with an external community ID. If you complete the operation according to our requirements, we may store the associated information between your public key and external community ID.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Customer Support </strong>- We may collect additional information you may disclose to our customer support team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="automatically-collected-information">Automatically collected information</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Metrics and Performance Data</strong> - We may collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes high level information about your activity (such as how you use our Services and how you interact with others using our Services), and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Device and Connection Information</strong> - We may collect device-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This may include your IP address and, if you choose to allow push notifications through PINs, your device’s unique push token.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Status Information</strong> - We may collect information about your online status on our Services, such as when you last used our Services (your “last seen status”).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-we-use-the-information-we-collect">How We Use The Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Our primary purpose in collecting information is to to help us operate, provide, improve, customize, support, and market our Services. We may use your information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide the Services and customer support you request;</li>
<li>Verify your account;</li>
<li>Resolve disputes and troubleshoot problems;</li>
<li>Prevent and investigate potentially prohibited or illegal activities, and/or violations of our posted Terms;</li>
<li>Customize, measure, and improve the Services and the content and layout of our application; and</li>
<li>Deliver targeted marketing and service update notices based on your communications preferences. </li>
<li>We will not use your information for purposes other than those purposes we have disclosed to you, without your permission.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="marketing">Marketing</h2>
<p>We will never sell or rent your information to third parties.
Any communications we send to you will either be related to your account or will be related to the Services. In the event we send any communication to you which is not related specifically to your account, we will provide you with an “unsubscribe” mechanism through which you may opt out of receiving other similar messages in the future.
We do not allow third-party banner ads on PINs, but if we ever do, we will update this policy.</p>
<h2 id="how-your-information-is-shared-with-other-pins-users">How Your Information Is Shared With Other PINs Users</h2>
<p>As PINs is built on the Web3 decentralized framework and is designed for community collaboration in creating and sharing content, any content you submit will be saved on decentralized nodes. When you delete your information, we cannot guarantee that the content you created will be deleted from all nodes. Other members of the community may still be able to see the information you created within the community.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-share-information-with-third-parties">How We Share Information With Third Parties</h2>
<p>We work with third-party providers to help us operate, provide, improve, customize, support, and market our Services. For example, we work with companies to distribute our apps, provide our infrastructure, delivery, and other systems. These providers may provide us information about you in certain circumstances; for example, app stores may provide us reports to help us diagnose and fix service issues.</p>
<p>We may also share information with law enforcement, government officials, or other third parties when:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are compelled to do so by a subpoena, court order, or similar legal procedure; or</li>
<li>We believe in good faith that the disclosure of personal information is necessary to prevent physical harm or financial loss, to report suspected illegal activity or to investigate violations of our Terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we may share information with companies or other entities that we plan to merge with or be acquired by. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Policy with respect to your personal information. You will receive prior notice of any change in applicable policy.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-use-cookies">How we use Cookies</h2>
<p>When you access our Services, we may place small data files called cookies or pixel tags on your computer or mobile device.
We use these files to understand, secure, operate, and provide our Services. For example, we use cookies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide all web-based Services, improve your experience, and understand how our Services are being used;</li>
<li>Measure the effectiveness of our promotions; and</li>
<li>Remember your choices and customize our Services for you</li>
</ul>
<p>You can follow the instructions provided by your browser or device (usually located under “Settings” or “Preferences”) to modify your cookie or pixel data settings. Please note that if you set your browser or device to disable cookies, certain of our Services may not function properly.</p>
<h2 id="how-you-can-access-or-change-your-information">How you can access or change your information</h2>
<p>Since PINs are built on a Web3 framework, you will most likely not be able to delete content that you have shared, posted and uploaded before a certain point in time. In addition, You can destroy the private key that represents your account, but this does not directly destroy the account&#39;s historical trace on PINs, and this does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in VERSE which may continue to be visible to other VERSE members.</p>
<p>If you need to block certain content on the client side, you can initiate a request to us and we will block the content belonging to you on the client side within 90 days.</p>
<h2 id="our-global-operations">Our Global Operations</h2>
<p>You agree to our information practices, including the collection, use, processing, and sharing of your information as described in this Privacy Policy, as well as the transfer and processing of your information to the United States and other countries globally where we have or use facilities, service providers, or partners, regardless of where you use our Services.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or processed may be different from those of your own country. However, we require our service providers to treat your information in strict confidence and use appropriate security measures to protect it. We also require them to uphold all obligations under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2 id="updates-to-our-policy">Updates To Our Policy</h2>
<p>We may amend or update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes to this policy by updating the last updated date at the top of this page, and we will provide you with explicit notice of material changes as required by law. Your continued use of our Services confirms your acceptance of our Privacy Policy, as amended. If you do not agree to our Privacy Policy, as amended, you must stop using our Services.
