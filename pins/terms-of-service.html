<h1 id="terms-of-service">PINs Terms of Service</h1>
<p>PINs is an ecological application based on the EMIT decentralized protocol, which is built on top of the EMIT protocol and the Web3 framework. PINs allow people to build their own VERSE and create content in the form of multiplayer role-playing games. These Terms govern your use of PINs and the other products, features, applications, services, technologies and software that we offer (the PINs Products or Products), except where we expressly state that separate terms (and not these Terms) apply. These Products are provided to you by PINs. </p>
<p><em>Please note that all client software for PINs has been developed and maintained by <strong>Engine Link Future Technology PTE LTD</strong> to date.</em></p>
<p>We will not charge you for the use of PINs or the other products and services covered by these Terms unless we state otherwise. </p>
<p>For more information about our privacy practices, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>
<h2 id="1-the-services-we-provide">1. The services we provide</h2>
<p>Our mission is to provide a Web3 social tool that allows people to work together to create multiple metaverses with episodic properties in the form of multiplayer role-playing games and to bring historical and cultural attributes to the metaverse community. To help advance this mission, we provide the Products and services described below to you:</p>
<p><strong>Decentralized Identity Management:</strong> </p>
<p>We offer decentralized identity management to help you manage your decentralized identity on your local device. This identity is a string of random keys that you provide yourself to use for authorization in lieu of your activity in PINs, so this identity essentially has nothing to do with your real identity and is not uploaded to the server side of PINs regardless of the time of day.</p>
<p><strong>Provide a personalized experience for you:</strong></p>
<p>The VERSE you see on the PINs home page is different from others. For example, we use data about your activities - to personalize your experience.</p>
<p><strong>Connect you with VERSEs and ACTORs you care about:</strong></p>
<p>We help you find and connect with the VERSE, ACTORs, and DAO organizations you care about in the PINs products you use. We use the data on the front-end to make suggestions for you and others - for example, VERSE to follow or join, ACTORs of interest, and ROLEs in a particular VERSE that you care about. We believe our service is most useful when people are connected to the VERSE, ROLEs, and ACTORs they care about.</p>
<p><strong>Empower you to create VERSE and participate in activities in VERSE that you or others have created:</strong></p>
<p>There are many ways to participate in the creation of VERSE plots on PINs by collaborating with others to create and advancing the plot developments in VERSE - for example, you can create your own VERSE and decide how to move the plot forward in it. You can also create shared ROLEs in VERSE, created by yourself or others. You can also play the ROLEs in the parent VERSE and advance the plot with others.</p>
<p><strong>Promote the safety, security, and integrity of our services, combat harmful conduct and keep our community of users safe:</strong></p>
<p>People will only build a community on PINs products if they feel safe and secure. We work hard to maintain the security (including availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality) of our products and services. However, our service is built on EMIT-Core&#39;s Web3 framework and the user&#39;s account private key is always kept by the user, which means that if you lose or leak your private key, the consequences are beyond our control. </p>
<p>We are constantly looking for potential misuse of our products, harmful behavior toward others, and situations where we can help support or protect our community, including responding to user reports of potentially offensive content. When we learn of such content or conduct, we may take appropriate action based on our assessment, which may include notifying you, offering assistance, banning or restricting certain accounts and content, or contacting law enforcement. Please see our privacy policy for more information.</p>
<p>In some cases, the Oversight Board may review our decisions, subject to its terms and conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:</strong></p>
<p>We have used, are using, and will continue to develop advanced technologies - such as distributed networks, artificial intelligence, machine learning systems, and augmented reality - to enable people to use our products safely and securely, regardless of their physical ability or geographic location. For example, such technologies help people with visual impairments understand what or who is in photos or videos posted on PINs. We are also building complex decentralized networks and DAO organizations to enable more people to safely participate in decision making and various VERSE activities on PINs. And we are developing automated systems to improve our ability to detect and remove abusive and dangerous activity that could harm our community and the integrity of our products.</p>
<p><strong>Research ways to make our services better:</strong></p>
<p>We engage in research to develop, test, and improve our Products. This includes analyzing data we have about our users and understanding how people use our Products, for example by conducting surveys and testing and troubleshooting new features. Our Privacy Policy explains how we use data to support this research for the purposes of developing and improving our services.</p>
<p><strong>Ensuring access to our services:</strong></p>
<p>In order to operate our global services and enable you to build VERSE with the people around the world, we must transmit, store, and distribute content and data to our distributed nodes, data centers, partners, service providers, vendors, and systems around the world, including outside your country of residence. The use of this global infrastructure is necessary and essential to provide our services.</p>
<h2 id="2-your-commitments-to-pins-and-our-community">2. Your commitments to PINs and our community</h2>
<p>We provide these services to you and others to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:</p>
<h3 id="1-you-need-to-make-sure-you-know-the-following-facts-">1. You need to make sure you know the following facts.</h3>
<ul>
<li>PINs is a decentralized application. Your account in PINs is created entirely on the client side and kept by you, and you need to keep your mnemonics or private keys safe. You need to understand that the PINs operator cannot provide any help if you lose or leak your mnemonics or private key to a third party.</li>
<li>PINs is a decentralized, anonymous, collaborative tool for creating virtual plots.</li>
<li>Each VERSE in PINs is a fictional plot universe, and the plot developments within it are purely fictional. It does not imply that these episodes take place in the real world.</li>
<li>Any non-NOKI ROLEs in PINs are spontaneously created and shared by users or third parties.</li>
<li>A non-NOKI ROLE in any VERSE in PINs exists only in that VERSE, and can be played by anyone. Even if a ROLE&#39;s name or image are similar or identical to a real-world ROLE, it does not mean that the ROLE is a real-world man.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-who-can-use-pins">2. Who can use PINs</h3>
<p>When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this reason, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create only one account (your own) and use it for personal purposes.</li>
<li>Never share private key/mnemonic word/password of your account, give access to your PINs account to others, or transfer your account to anyone else (without our permission).</li>
</ul>
<p>We try to make PINs broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use PINs if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are under 13 years old.</li>
<li>You are a convicted sex offender.</li>
<li>We&#39;ve previously disabled your account for violations of our Terms or the Community Standards, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of PINs. If we disable your account for a violation of our Terms, the Community Standards, or other terms and policies, you agree not to create another account without our permission. Receiving permission to create a new account is provided at our sole discretion, and does not mean or imply that the disciplinary action was wrong or without cause.</li>
<li>You are prohibited from receiving our products, services, or software under applicable laws.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3-what-you-can-share-and-do-on-pins">3. What you can share and do on PINs</h3>
<p>We want people to use PINs products to create VERSE, ROLEs, and storylines through collaboration, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):</p>
<ol>
<li>You may not use our Products to do or share anything:<ul>
<li>That violates these Terms, the Community Standards, or other terms and policies that apply to your use of our Products.</li>
<li>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent (or assists someone else in using our Products in such a way).</li>
<li>That you do not own or have the necessary rights to share.</li>
<li>That infringes or violates someone else&#39;s rights, including their intellectual property rights (such as by infringing another’s copyright or trademark, or distributing or selling counterfeit or pirated goods), unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You may not upload viruses or malicious code, use the services to send spam, or do anything else that could disable, overburden, interfere with, or impair the proper working, integrity, operation, or appearance of our services, systemes, or Products.</li>
<li>You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.</li>
<li>You may not proxy, request, or collect Product usernames or passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.</li>
<li>You may not sell, license, or purchase any data obtained from us or our services, except as provided in the Platform Terms.</li>
<li>You may not misuse any reporting, flagging, dispute, or appeals channel, such as by making fraudulent, duplicative, or groundless reports or appeals.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can remove or restrict access to content that is in violation of these provisions. We can also suspend or disable your account for conduct that violates these provisions, as provided in Section 3.B.</p>
<p>If we remove content that you have shared in violation of the Community Standards, we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request another review, unless you seriously or repeatedly violate these Terms or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons. For information on account suspension or termination, see Section 3.B below.</p>
<p>To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your rights (including intellectual property rights) or our terms and policies, if this feature exists in your jurisdiction.</p>
<p>We also can remove or restrict access to content features, services, or information if we determine that doing so is reasonably necessary to avoid or mitigate misuse of our services or adverse legal or regulatory impacts to PINs.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-permissions-you-give-us">4. The permissions you give us</h3>
<p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Permission to use content you create and share: Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.</p>
<p>You retain ownership of the intellectual property rights (things like copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on PINs and other PINs Products you use. Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content with anyone else, wherever you want.</p>
<p>However, to provide our services we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a &quot;license&quot;) to use this content. This is solely for the purposes of providing and improving our Products and services as described in Section 1 above.</p>
<p>Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and create derivative works of your content (consistent with your privacy and application settings). This means, for example, that if you share a photo on PINs, you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others (again, consistent with your settings) such as PINs Products or service providers that support those products and services. This license will end when your content is deleted from our systems.</p>
<p>Since PINs are built on a Web3 framework, you will most likely not be able to delete content that you have shared, posted and uploaded before a certain point in time. In addition, You can destroy the private key that represents your account, but this does not directly destroy the account&#39;s historical trace on PINs, and this does not automatically delete content that you post as an admin of a page or content that you create collectively with other users, such as photos in VERSE which may continue to be visible to other VERSE members.</p>
<p>If you need to block certain content on the client side, you can initiate a request to us and we will block the content belonging to you on the client side within 90 days.</p>
<p>Content will not be deleted within 90 days of the content deletion process beginning in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>where your content has been used by others in accordance with this license and they have not deleted it (in which case this license will continue to apply until that content is deleted);</li>
<li>where deletion within 90 days is not possible due to technical limitations of our systems, in which case, we will complete the deletion as soon as technically feasible; or</li>
<li>where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:<ul>
<li>investigate or identify illegal activity or violations of our terms and policies (for example, to identify or investigate misuse of our Products or systems);</li>
<li>protect the safety, integrity, and security of our Products, systems, services, our employees, and users, and to defend ourselves;</li>
<li>comply with legal obligations for the preservation of evidence, including data Companies providing financial products and services preserve to comply with any record keeping obligations required by law; or</li>
<li>comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in which case, the content will be retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact duration will vary on a case-by-case basis).</p>
<p>In each of the above cases, this license will continue until the content has been fully deleted.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Permission to use your name, profile picture, and information about your actions with ads and sponsored or commercial content: You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions you have taken on PINs next to or in connection with ads, offers, and other sponsored or commercial content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you. </p>
</li>
<li><p>Permission to update software you use or download: If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software where available.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="5-limits-on-using-our-intellectual-property">5. Limits on using our intellectual property</h3>
<p>If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on PINs), we retain all rights to that content (but not yours). You can only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage Guidelines or with our prior written permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source license) to modify, translate, create derivative works of, decompile, or reverse engineer our products or their components, or otherwise attempt to extract source code from us, unless an exception or limitation applies under applicable law.</p>
<h2 id="3-additional-provisions">3. Additional provisions</h2>
<h3 id="1-updating-our-terms">1. Updating our Terms</h3>
<p>We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community. As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices, to promote a safe and secure experience on our Products and services, and/or to comply with applicable law. We will only make any changes if the provisions are no longer appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your interests or if the changes are required for safety and security purposes or to comply with applicable law.</p>
<p>We will notify you (for example, through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect, unless changes are required by law. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by them if you continue to use our Products.</p>
<p>However, you should know that due to the decentralized nature of Web3, the private key of your account is in your possession and we are not able to delete your account. If you do not agree with our updated terms and do not want to be part of the PINs community anymore, we can only lock your account at the client level.</p>
<h3 id="2-account-suspension-or-termination">2. Account suspension or termination</h3>
<p>We want PINs to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>If we determine, in our discretion, that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular the Community Standards, we may suspend or permanently disable your access to PINs Products, and we may permanently block your account through the client. We may also block your account through the client if you repeatedly infringe other people’s intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.</p>
<p>We may block your account through the client if after registration your account is not confirmed, your account is unused and remains inactive for an extended period of time, or if we detect someone may have used it without your permission and we are unable to confirm your ownership of the account. </p>
<p>Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or operation of any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.</p>
<p>You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have disabled your account by mistake.</p>
<p>If you delete or we disable or delete your account, these Terms shall terminate as an agreement between you and us, but the following provisions will remain in place: 2, 3.2-3.5.</p>
<h3 id="3-limits-on-liability">3. Limits on liability</h3>
<p>We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products, however, are provided &quot;as is,&quot; and to the extent permissible by law, we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).</p>
<p>We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms or the PINs Products (however caused and on any theory of liability, including negligence), even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
<h3 id="4-disputes">4. Disputes</h3>
<p>We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it&#39;s useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.</p>
<p>If you are a consumer, the laws of the country in which you reside will apply to any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the PINs Products, and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that country that has jurisdiction over the claim. In all other cases, and for any claim, cause of action, or dispute that PINs files against you, you and PINs agree that any such claim, cause of action or dispute must be resolved exclusively in the Singapore or U.S. Colorado courts. You also agree that you submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of Colorado will govern these Terms and any claim, cause of action, or dispute without regard to conflict of law provisions. Without prejudice to the foregoing, you agree that, in its sole discretion, PINs may bring any claim, cause of action, or dispute we have against you in any competent court in the country in which you reside that has jurisdiction over the claim.</p>
<h3 id="5-other">5. Other</h3>
<ol>
<li>These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement between you and PINs. regarding your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.</li>
<li>Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. To the extent any supplemental terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.</li>
<li>If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be deemed amended to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable, and if it can’t be made enforceable, then it will be severed and the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.</li>
<li>You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.</li>
<li>These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.</li>
<li>We may change the username for your account in certain circumstances.</li>
<li>We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But we may use feedback and other suggestions without any restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.</li>
<li>We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li>
</ol>
